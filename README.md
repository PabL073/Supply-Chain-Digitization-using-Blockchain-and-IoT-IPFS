# Supply-Chain-Digitization-using-Blockchain-and-IoT-IPFS
This project develops a blockchain-based system for enhanced supply chain transparency and traceability, integrating IoT for real-time monitoring. Initially storing data on-chain, it later adopts IPFS for scalability. Tests confirm its viability, and future phases aim to refine the system for broader industry applications and improved efficiency.

The digitization of supply chains is crucial for improving efficiency and 
ensuring the transparency of goods' lifecycle. This project develops a comprehensive 
blockchain-based system designed to enhance traceability in supply chain 
management. The system leverages a decentralized framework utilizing smart 
contracts and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to securely store and manage data.  
Integration with IoT systems is another significant aspect, where data from 
IoT devices, such as temperature sensors, are used to monitor and record 
environmental conditions of shipments in real-time. This data is crucial for 
maintaining product quality and compliance throughout the supply chain.  The 
application features detailed management capabilities for products and shipments, 
including the addition, tracking, and updating of product information stored on the 
blockchain. 
This project also investigates the performance of blockchain-based systems 
for supply chain management by conducting experiments with different smart 
contract implementations. Initially, all data was stored directly on the blockchain. To 
enhance scalability and reduce costs, a subsequent experiment introduced the 
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to handle data storage, keeping only essential 
references on the blockchain.The comparative analysis showed that integrating IPFS 
significantly improved the system's efficiency and scalability. This progression 
highlights the advantages of hybrid data management strategies in blockchain 
environments. 
Further testing on a private production blockchain not only confirmed the 
practical viability of this approach but also showcased its strong potential for 
integration into real-world supply chain management systems. This proof of concept 
paves the way for more extensive applications and suggests a robust framework for 
future deployments.  
In the next phases of this project, we plan to address the limitations that were 
identified during these initial tests. Our aim is to refine the systemâ€™s capabilities 
further and explore a wider range of applications, enhancing both the scalability and 
the operational efficiency of the blockchain system. This will involve fine-tuning the 
existing features and potentially incorporating new functionalities to meet the 
evolving needs of different types of industries.
